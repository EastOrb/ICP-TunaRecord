* Ensure that your canister code is of high quality. It should be well-structured, efficient, follow best practices, and thoroughly documented, with no bugs or issues.
* Please publish your canister code on GitHub and submit the link to your GitHub repository, such as https://github.com/ubinix-warun/ICP-TunaRecord. Please also include any necessary instructions for deploying and testing your canister.
